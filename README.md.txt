Cloud Computing course project

This is a Java based application to simulate a key manager that can encrypt keys used for data encryption on the cloud.
It can act as an interface between Cloud Providers and customers to maintain a level of data privacy for users.
To speed up the process of encryption-decryption, we can use C-aware, a prefetching algorithm to intelligently monitor data that is most frequently accessed on the cloud.
